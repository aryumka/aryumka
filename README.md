### 👋 Hi, I'm Aryumka

Used to plan products. Now I build them.  
Finance background + curious brain = dev who actually asks *why*, not just *how*.

I care about writing code that’s easy to understand and hard to mess up.  
Love diving into complex problems and making things feel simple.

Lately exploring functional programming, and still Googling “how to name things” more than I should.

Let’s build something that makes sense — and actually helps people.

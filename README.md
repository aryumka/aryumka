### 👋 Hi, I'm Aryumka

I used to be a product manager in finance.  
Now I write code — mostly Kotlin, mostly backend.

I care about writing code that’s easy to understand and hard to mess up.  
Love diving into complex problems and making things feel simple.

Lately exploring functional programming, and still Googling “how to name things” more than I should.

Let’s build something that makes sense — and actually helps people.

### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Aryumka

I'm a developer with a background in finance and product management, passionate about building software that delivers real value to users. I care deeply about clean architecture, domain-driven design (DDD), and functional programming â€” not just as buzzwords, but as practical tools to model complexity and solve meaningful problems.

I transitioned into software development by combining structured learning with self-driven exploration, and I enjoy diving deep into systems to understand not just *how* they work, but *why* they should work that way.

ðŸ›  **What I work with:**
- Kotlin, Java, Spring Boot, WebFlux  
- Arrow, coroutines, and functional error handling  
- Hexagonal architecture, event-driven systems  

ðŸ’¡ **What I care about:**
- Delivering real user value through thoughtful design and execution  
- Understanding domains deeply and modeling them clearly  
- Learning continuously and sharing insights with others

ðŸ“š Currently exploring: advanced functional techniques in Kotlin, and AI-assisted developer workflows.

Letâ€™s build something meaningful together.

### 👋 Hi, I'm Aryumka 🧠➡️💻

Used to plan products. Now I build them.  
Finance background + curious brain = dev who actually asks *why*, not just *how*.

I write backend code in Kotlin, think in DDD.
Love turning messy domains into clean logic. Also love coffee.

Currently mixing functional programming with real-world backend chaos.  
Let’s make things that make sense — and work.
